📘 Day 25 – Git Reset vs Revert & Branching Strategies
🎯 Objective

Learn how to safely undo mistakes in Git and understand real-world branching strategies used by engineering teams.

✅ Task 1: Git Reset — Hands-On
🔹 Experiment Setup

Created 3 commits:

Commit A

Commit B

Commit C

🔹 git reset --soft HEAD~1

What happened?

Commit C was removed from history.

Changes from Commit C stayed in the staging area.

Files were ready to commit again.

✅ Nothing was lost. Only commit history moved back.

🔹 git reset --mixed HEAD~1

What happened?

Commit removed from history.

Changes moved to working directory.

Files were NOT staged.

✅ Changes still exist but need git add again.

🔹 git reset --hard HEAD~1

What happened?

Commit removed.

Changes deleted from staging area.

Changes deleted from working directory.

❌ Changes were permanently lost.

🔎 Difference Between --soft, --mixed, and --hard
Option	Commit History	Staging Area	Working Directory
--soft	Moves back	Keeps staged changes	Keeps changes
--mixed	Moves back	Unstages changes	Keeps changes
--hard	Moves back	Removes staged	Deletes changes
❗ Which One Is Destructive?

git reset --hard is destructive because it deletes changes permanently.

🧠 When To Use Each?

--soft → Fix last commit message or combine commits.

--mixed → Unstage files but keep changes.

--hard → Completely discard changes (be very careful).

🚨 Should You Use Reset on Pushed Commits?

❌ No.
It rewrites history and breaks collaboration.

Only use on local, unpushed commits.

✅ Task 2: Git Revert — Hands-On
🔹 Setup

Created:

Commit X

Commit Y

Commit Z

Ran:

git revert <commit-Y-hash>
🔎 What Happened?

A new commit was created.

It reversed the changes introduced in Commit Y.

Commit Y is still visible in history.

🔎 Is Commit Y Still in History?

✅ Yes.
Git created a new commit that undid Y instead of deleting it.

🔎 Reset vs Revert Difference
Feature	git reset	git revert
Rewrites history?	Yes	No
Safe for shared branches?	No	Yes
Creates new commit?	No	Yes
Deletes commits?	Yes	No
🧠 Why Revert Is Safer?

Because it does NOT rewrite history.
It simply adds a new commit that cancels previous changes.

Perfect for shared branches like main.

🧠 When To Use?

reset → Local cleanup before pushing.

revert → Undo changes in shared branches.

✅ Task 3: Reset vs Revert — Summary
Feature	git reset	git revert
What it does	Moves branch pointer backward	Creates new commit that undoes changes
Removes commit from history?	Yes	No
Safe for shared branches?	No	Yes
When to use	Local cleanup	Undo pushed commits safely
✅ Task 4: Branching Strategies
1️⃣ GitFlow
📌 How It Works

Uses multiple long-lived branches:

main

develop

feature/*

release/*

hotfix/*

📊 Flow Diagram
main ────────────────●───────────●
        \ 
         develop ────●────●────●
              \        \
            feature   release
📍 Used In

Large teams with scheduled releases.

✅ Pros

Structured

Good for versioned releases

❌ Cons

Complex

Slower for fast startups

2️⃣ GitHub Flow
📌 How It Works

Single main branch

Create feature branch

Pull request

Merge to main

📊 Flow
main ───●────●────●
         \
        feature ──●──→ merge
📍 Used In

Startups & SaaS products deploying continuously.

✅ Pros

Simple

Fast

CI/CD friendly

❌ Cons

Not ideal for heavy release cycles

3️⃣ Trunk-Based Development
📌 How It Works

Everyone commits to main

Short-lived branches (1–2 days max)

📊 Flow
main ──●─●─●─●─●─●
      ↑  ↑  ↑
    small frequent commits
📍 Used In

High-performing DevOps teams.

✅ Pros

Fast delivery

Less merge conflict

❌ Cons

Requires strong CI/CD

Needs disciplined team

🎯 Strategy Answers

🚀 Startup shipping fast? → GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based

🏢 Large team with scheduled releases? → GitFlow

⭐ Many open-source projects (like Linux & Kubernetes) use a variation of Trunk-Based Development.

✅ Task 5: Git Commands Reference (Days 22–25)
🔧 Setup & Config
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git init
📂 Basic Workflow
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git log
git diff
🌿 Branching
git branch
git branch feature-name
git checkout feature-name
git switch feature-name
🌍 Remote
git clone <url>
git remote -v
git push origin main
git pull origin main
git fetch
🔀 Merging & Rebasing
git merge branch-name
git rebase branch-name
📦 Stash & Cherry Pick
git stash
git stash pop
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
🔄 Reset & Revert
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git revert <commit-hash>
🏁 Final Learning

Reset rewrites history.

Revert preserves history.

Branching strategy depends on team size & release model.

Never rewrite public history.
